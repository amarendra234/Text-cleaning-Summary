Project Summary
The Text Cleaning App is a Python-based Django application designed to clean and preprocess text input. The application includes features such as:

Text Cleaning: The app removes special characters and extra whitespaces from the text, normalizing it for further processing.
REST API: A RESTful API is created using Django REST Framework that allows users to submit text data and receive cleaned text in response.
Load Balancing: The app is deployed behind NGINX configured for load balancing. Multiple server instances are run to handle high traffic, ensuring availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.
High Availability: NGINX distributes traffic across two Django server instances running on different ports (8001 and 8002) for optimal performance and availability.
Key Components of the Project
Django Application: The core of the app is developed using Django, a Python-based web framework that provides features like URL routing, middleware support, and database integration.

Django REST Framework: Used to build the API for text cleaning. The API receives text input via POST requests, processes it, and returns the cleaned version of the text.

Text Cleaning Logic: The text cleaning function removes:

Non-alphanumeric characters using regular expressions (\W+).
Extra whitespaces (\s+), ensuring a clean and standardized result.
NGINX Load Balancing: NGINX is configured to balance traffic across multiple instances of the Django app running on different ports (8001 and 8002). This ensures that the application can handle more traffic and offers higher availability.

Health Checks & Custom Routing: NGINX checks the health of the Django instances and ensures traffic is only routed to healthy servers. Custom routing rules can be defined in NGINX to manage traffic efficiently.

Steps to Explain the Project in an Interview
Overview of the Project:

Start by explaining the problem the app solves: cleaning and preprocessing text data.
Mention that the app is scalable, reliable, and built with a focus on handling large amounts of traffic efficiently.
How Text Cleaning Works:

Describe the logic behind the text cleaning function.
Emphasize how regular expressions (\W+ and \s+) are used to remove special characters and extra whitespaces.
Django & Django REST Framework:

Discuss the choice of Django for the project due to its simplicity, scalability, and built-in features.
Explain how Django REST Framework is used to expose the text cleaning functionality as an API endpoint (/api/clean/).
NGINX Load Balancing:

Explain the need for load balancing and NGINX in this project to manage high-traffic scenarios.
Describe how NGINX forwards requests to different Django instances running on different ports.
Highlight the health checks that ensure only healthy servers handle requests, preventing downtime.
Mention that NGINX helps distribute the load and enhances the appâ€™s fault tolerance and scalability.
Key Benefits of Using NGINX:

High Availability: Multiple instances of the Django app ensure that if one server fails, others can take over.
Scalability: The system can handle more users by adding more server instances.
Improved Performance: NGINX can manage thousands of concurrent connections more efficiently than a single server.
Follow-up Questions You May Encounter
Why did you use NGINX for load balancing instead of a cloud service (e.g., AWS ELB)?

Answer: NGINX provides greater flexibility and control over the load balancing process. It allows for fine-tuning of routing rules, more granular control over traffic distribution, and is often more cost-effective for smaller or self-hosted setups.
Can you explain how NGINX handles failover?

Answer: NGINX uses health checks to monitor server status. If a server instance becomes unresponsive or goes down, NGINX automatically stops routing traffic to it and reroutes requests to healthy instances.
What other performance optimizations can be made to this system?

Answer:
Caching responses at the NGINX level to reduce load on the backend servers.
Using asynchronous tasks (e.g., Celery) for any heavy text processing if needed.
Implementing database optimizations if the app grows and starts requiring persistent storage.
How would you scale this app to handle more traffic in the future?

Answer:
Horizontal scaling: Add more Django server instances and adjust NGINX configuration accordingly.
Vertical scaling: Upgrade the hardware resources of the current servers.
Consider using a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud to automatically scale resources as traffic spikes.
How did you ensure the NGINX load balancer is secure?

Answer:
Ensured that NGINX is set up with proper SSL/TLS certificates for encryption.
Used proxy_set_header directives in NGINX to preserve client information.
Limited access to the backend servers to only be accessible via NGINX (no direct external access).
What would you do if the app needs to process larger text inputs or more complex text processing?

Answer: For larger text processing, I would:
Use background tasks with a task queue (e.g., Celery) to process large text asynchronously.
Store intermediate results in a cache or database to avoid processing the same data multiple times.
Consider optimizing the regular expression used in the text cleaning logic to handle larger text efficiently.
What are some potential bottlenecks in this system?

Answer: Potential bottlenecks include:
The text cleaning logic if the processing is very resource-intensive or slow. This can be improved with optimization or offloading to background workers.
NGINX configuration: Overloading NGINX or improper configuration might affect load balancing and traffic distribution.
Database scaling: If persistent data storage is added in the future, ensuring that the database can scale with high traffic is crucial.
How would you monitor the system for performance and uptime?

Answer: I would use tools like NGINX access logs and error logs for tracking traffic and identifying issues. Additionally, services like Prometheus and Grafana could be used for system monitoring and alerting. I would also implement regular health checks on both the application and NGINX to ensure uptime.
How would you improve the text-cleaning process if it needed to handle more complex data (e.g., multi-language text)?

Answer: I would:
Use more advanced text processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy for handling text in multiple languages.
Implement language detection and customize the cleaning process based on the detected language.
Support more complex operations, like stemming and lemmatization, to improve text normalization.
